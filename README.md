## Description
Think you can use your data science smarts to make big predictions at a molecular level?

This challenge aims to predict interactions between atoms. Imaging technologies like MRI enable us to see and understand the 
molecular composition of tissues. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is a closely related technology which uses the same principles
to understand the structure and dynamics of proteins and molecules.

Researchers around the world conduct NMR experiments to further understanding of the structure and dynamics of molecules, across 
areas like environmental science, pharmaceutical science, and materials science. 
# Objective
To develop an algorithm that can predict the magnetic interaction between two atoms in a molecule (i.e., the scalar coupling constant).
